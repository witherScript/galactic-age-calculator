Determines how many years have passed on each planet since a past birthday.


56 and we want to calculate how many years have passed since their 43 birthday, we would find the following results:
13 Earth years have passed.
54.16 Mercury years have passed.
20.96 Venus years have passed.
6.91 Mars years have passed.
1.09 Jupiter years have passed.
Determines how many years have yet to pass until a future birthday. For example, if a user is 56 years and we want to calculate how many years have yet to pass until they are 61 years old, we would find the following results:
5 Earth years have yet to pass.
20.83 Mercury years have yet to pass.
8.06 Venus years have yet to pass.
2.65 Mars years have yet to pass.
0.42 Jupiter years have yet to pass.
